# Hello-World
Here is an example of a project that I recently worked on.

### Project Title  
Movie Ratings Analyzer

### Description  
Movie Ratings Analyzer is a simple Python project that reads in a dataset of movies and their ratings, then performs data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

The program helps users quickly identify trends in movie ratings, average scores, and genre popularity using data manipulation and graphing tools.  

### Tools Used  
- Python 3.11  
- Pandas (for data cleaning & analysis)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for testing and exploration)  
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
  
### Files Used  
- `movies.csv` → Contains the raw dataset with movie titles, genres, and ratings  
- `analyze_movies.py` → Main Python script that runs the analysis  
- `visualize.py` → Helper script for generating graphs  
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file)

#### Thank you for viewing!
